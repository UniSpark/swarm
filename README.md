Swarming Algorithm for Virtual Drones

This code repository is dedicated to creating a swarming algorithm that will allow a number of virtual drones to hover over a rider and carry them around in 3D space.  Each member traingluates with its clodest 2 neighbors and then global trajectory is passed from the manager based on User Input.
